## Introduction

Plugin Flutter which can handle WiFi connections (AP, STA)

Becareful, some commands as no effect on iOS because Apple don't let us to do whatever we want...

## WiFi connections

:white_check_mark:(1) : On iOS, you can only disconnect from a network which has been added by your app. In order to disconnect from a system network, you have to connect to an other!

:warning:(2) : On iOS, you can forget a WiFi network by connecting to it with the joinOnce flag to true!

:warning:(3) : On iOS, you can just getting the SSID, or maybe(probably) I'm missing something! 

:question:(4) : I think there is a way to get the IP address but for now, this is not implemented..

:question:(5) : Possbile only if you get NEHotspotHelper approval to use the API


## Access Point
|                                       Description                                     |      Android       |         iOS          |
